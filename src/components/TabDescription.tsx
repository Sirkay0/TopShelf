        Jungle Diamonds is a slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (60%
        indica/40% sativa) created through crossing the infamous Slurricane X
        Gorilla Glue #4 strains. Named for its gorgeous appearance and breeder,
        Jungle Diamonds is a favorite of indica and hybrid lovers alike thanks
        to its delicious taste and tingly, arousing high. Jungle Diamonds buds
        have sparkling oversized spade-shaped olive green nugs with vivid amber
        hairs and a thick frosty blanket of glittering tiny blue-tinted white
        crystal trichomes. As you pull apart each sticky little nugget, aromas
        of spicy mocha coffee and fruity herbs are released.{" "}

        The flavor is of sweet chocolate with hints of fresh ripe berries to it,
        too. The Jungle Diamonds high is just as delicious, with happy effects
        that will boost the spirits and kick negative thoughts and moods to the
        curb. You’ll feel a tingly sense in your body from start to finish that
        serves to remove any aches or pains while leaving you pretty aroused at
        times. This is accompanied by a blissfully unfocused heady lift that
        leaves your head in the clouds without causing sedation. With these
        effects and its pretty high 17-24% THC level, Jungle Diamonds is ideal
        for experienced patients with chronic pain, cramps or muscle spasms and
        appetite loss or nausea.
